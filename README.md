🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

This is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python, built to practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and data structures.

The game randomly selects a word from a word list, and the player has a limited number of lives to guess the word one letter at a time. With each wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn until the game is either won or lost.

✨ Features

🎲 Random word selection from a word file

🔤 Letter-by-letter guessing system

✅ Input validation (only valid letters allowed)

♻️ Prevents repeated guesses

❤️ Limited lives system

🎨 ASCII hangman visuals for each life

📂 Clean project structure with separate files

🧠 Beginner-friendly logic, easy to understand and extend
